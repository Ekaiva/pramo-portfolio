# Portfolio (React + Vite)

This is a simple, modern portfolio site for **Pramod Singh**, built with **React**, **TypeScript**, and **Vite**.

It includes:

- Hero section with a short intro
- About, Projects, Skills, and Contact sections
- Responsive layout and clean dark UI

## Getting started

From your terminal:

```bash
cd ~/Desktop/portfolio
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open the URL printed in the terminal (by default `http://localhost:5173`).

You can customize the content in:

- `src/App.tsx` – text, projects, skills, links
- `src/styles.css` – colors, spacing, layout
